Project name is Login Exercise. 

It is a simple web application made as a School project.
The starting URL takes users to a login-form. First step is to register as a user by filling in simple information like username and password. Then you can go back to the login-form and log in. Once you are logged in you will be able to view "THE SECRET SITE ".
